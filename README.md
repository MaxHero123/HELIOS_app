HELIOS: A Novel Machine Learning Pipeline for High-Accuracy Exoplanet Light-Curve Interpretation with Optimized Fourier Analysis and SMOTE Synthesis. A one-dimensional CNN trained on augmented transit data (Fourier Analysis, Savitzy-Golay Filter, Robust-Scaling, Normalization, and SMOTE) to detect exoplanetary presence in extra-solar systems.
